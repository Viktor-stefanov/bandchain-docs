# Using the Dataset in the Frontend

There are two ways of querying data from Band Standard Dataset to use in front-end: through Bandchain.js or REST endpoint.

We recommend using Bandchain.js for the ease of use.

For guide to using Bandchain.js , you may find examples and documentation [here](/client-library/bandchain.js/getting-started.html).

For guide to using REST endpoint, you may find our guide [here](/technical-specifications/band-cli-rest-endpoints.html).
