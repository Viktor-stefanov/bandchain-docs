# Requesting Data from BandChain

**Band Protocol allows supported blockchain to query data from traditional web APIs and use it on their blockchain**. Developers can make queries through BandChain, a Cosmos-based blockchain for facilitating oracle requests, and then use the data in their dApps through inter-chain communication. Integrating oracle data can be done in 3 simple steps:

- Choosing the oracle scripts
- Requesting Data from BandChain
- Using the data in smart contracts

In this section, we will explore how you can accomplish each of the steps. You will be able to create your first oracle-powered dApp on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains using Solidity.
